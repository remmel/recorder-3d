# 3D Recorder

3D Recorder allows you to save the RGB and Depth images along their world poses (rotation and position) from your Huawei phone (with a Tof camera). [ðŸ’¾ Download last Android APK](https://github.com/remmel/recorder-3d/releases).

Thoses image can be visualized on the mobile itself or on my [online viewer](https://remmel.github.com/image-processing-js/pose-viewer.html).

You can choose how often to save the images and the rgb resolution (up to 3968x2976). Thus if you choose a small resolution (eg 1440x1080) you can create a [3d video](https://remy-mellet.com/image-processing-js/rgbds-viewer.html).  
If you choose a too big resolution the fps will drop and thus a few images per second will be saved.

## Features
- Save depth (240x180, binary DEPTH16 and 16bits grayscale PNG "OpenCV CV_16UC1")
- Save 2 rgb images (1 VGA + 1 with choosen resolution max 3264x2448)
- Save poses in CSV [download sample](doc/poses.csv)
- Export RGBD into PLY files [download sample](Recorder3D/src/test/resources/00000012.ply)
- Poses viewer and video editor (webview)

## Bonus feature : Measure

Measure the distance of the center (depth) of the object to the camera (center depth pixel)

## Android smarphone

That app has only been tested on Honor View 20 which has a tof sensor. This is the cheapest Huawei phone with Tof, you can find 2nd hand around 180â‚¬.

# Next
- Improve photo quality : I should make an alternative with Camera2 API https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk/issues/120, which allow to access camera properly
- Improve video framerate and resolution : currently 30fps (1440x1080) or 25fps 4K (3968x2976  jpg quality 80%)
  Use MediaRecorder to save video. Should probably use ARCore or Camera2 API
  Or check alternative with opengl surface
  
# Bug
It seems that there is an offset of 1 between rgb and depth eg: 00000182_image.jpg == 00000183_depth16.bin (check in my sync-rgbd.html)
